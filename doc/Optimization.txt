This file contains optimization tips for future class Optimizator. The main
purpose of this class is in reducing of binary code length and removing of
unused and stupid commands.

- All lines after last echo command may be removed. Example:

  0: inc v1
  1: echo v1       # last echo command
  2: jumpz v1 l3

  In this case jumpz command should be removed
- If jump command hasn't any jump commands before it, then all this jump
  related section should be removed. Example:

  0: inc v1
  1: jump l3
  2: add v1 v2

  In this case jump command just block line 2, so code from 1 to 2 line
  is dead.

  0: jump l2
  1: jump l3
  2: add v1 v2

  In this case jump command shouldn't be removed, because this script
  contains jumpz command, which jumps over the jump command.

Ideas for Evo project

- Every organism, should have input and output interfaces. Is an ability
  to grab and produce some data. By input i mean any outside data like
  environment properties (gravity, particle type and so on).
  TODO: this section needs for more details about particles and world...
- The world consists of particles. The particle has type and weight. The
  weight is amount of energy, which is in a particle.
- Organisms consists of particles (body), interpreter and the script.
- Every particle may be used like a sensor (input). It returns a value,
  which is a sum of all other particles weights in special direction.
  For example:

  Organism tries to obtain an input from X particle
    X --------> o
    Organism's  p1
    particle    w2

  where:
    X - Our organism's particle
    o - Other particle with type 1 (p2) and weight 2 (w2)

    feel(X, 0) = [p1, w2]

  where
    X - Our organism
    0 - Zero angle

  Example 2:

       O p1, w3
      /
    X
    Organism's
    particle

    feel(X, 45) = [p1, w3]

- Every particle may be used like a signal receiver (output). The type and
  weight of it may be changed by organism. So, it's possible for other
  organism to 'see' the type and weight of this particle
- The type of the particle may be visualized by color
- Use workers for many instances of organisms
- GPU support
- Create code optimizer
- Text2Bin script class
- Try profiler and mem leaks tools
- Organism class should be implemented as classic class. We need to create
  as many instance as many organisms we need. Every instance should work in
  separate web worker. Very important issue here is performance. We need to
  use timers in separate workers to lover CPU load. The same story like
  Evo.BLOCKING_ITERATIONS.
- All configs from Evo namespace should be changed from user console.
- Add config for mutation speed
- Every organism has an energy value. This value is set from the scratch and
  is decreased during it's life. It's possible to increase amount of energy
  by grabbing it from nearest objects like other organisms or energy particles.
  If amount of energy is increasing during some period, then the organism
  has been mutating in a good direction. If amount of energy is near zero,
  then the organism will die.
- Add start amount of energy configuration
- Add decrease energy value config
- Add start memory size config

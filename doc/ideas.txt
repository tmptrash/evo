Ideas for Evo project

- Every organism, should have input and output interfaces. Is an ability
  to grab and produce some data. By input i mean any outside data like
  environment properties (gravity, particle type and so on).
- The world consists of particles. The particle has type and weight. The
  weight is amount of energy, which is in a particle.
- Organisms consists of particles (body), interpreter and the script.
- Every particle may be used like a sensor. It returns a value, which is
  a sum of all other particles weights in special direction. For example:

  Organism tries to obtain an input from X particle
    X --------> O --------> . --------> o
    Organism's  p1          p2          p3
    particle    w3          w1          w2

  where:
    X - Our organism's particle
    O - Other particle 1 with weight 3
    . - Other particle 2 with weight 1
    o - Other particle 3 with weight 2

    feel(X, 0) = w3 + w1 + w2 = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6

  where
    X - Our organism
    0 - Zero angle

  Example 2:

          . p2, w1
         /
       o p1, w2
      /
    X
    Organism's
    particle

    feel(X, 45) = w2 + w1 = 2 + 1 = 3

- Use workers for many instances of organisms
- GPU support
- Create code optimizer
- Text2Bin script class
- Try profiler and mem leaks tools
